Vellore Fort, built in 1566, is a historical stronghold known for its architecture, battles, and cultural diversity.
Construction and Early History: Built by the Vijayanagara chieftains Chinna Bommi Nayak and Thimma Nayak, the fort became an important military and administrative center after the fall of Vijayanagara's capital.

Key Historical Events: The fort witnessed conflicts including the Battle of Toppur (1616-17), Maratha and Mughal occupations, and rule by the Nawabs of Arcot. It was captured by the British in 1768 and was the site of the Vellore Mutiny of 1806, an early revolt against British rule.
Architecture and Significance: Famous for its granite walls, deep moat, and blend of cultural monuments, the fort houses Jalakandeswarar Temple, a mosque, and St. John’s Church, reflecting religious diversity. Tipu Mahal and Begum Mahal are other notable structures.
Today: Maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, Vellore Fort remains a popular tourist site showcasing South Indian military architecture and historical heritage.
